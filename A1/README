INTRODUCTION
-------------

This FLEX parser parses a a file written in SGML and outputs the tags of relevancy and its' embedded contents. This progam uses a global stack and a scanner in order to perform this.


REQUIREMENTS
-------------

This program requires:

	* flex
	* gcc

BUILD
--------

	1) 'cd' to the directory where the folder for this assignment exists.
	2) type 'make' and the project should build.
	3) 

TEST PLAN
-----------

This program was tested in chunks.

1) Regular expressions.
	* As the program was being built I would test the tokens created in the *.l file for correctness. I started by writing the embedded text tokens (WORD, NUMBER, APOSTROPHIZED, HYPHENATED, PUNCTUATION).


ASSUMPTIONS	
-------------

* For cases such as HYPHENATED and APOSTROPHIZED, if the token ends in "-" or "'", the trailing character will be treated as PUNCTUATION.
